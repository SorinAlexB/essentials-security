# Activities

Security Summer School most activities take the shape of **CTF challenges**.
CTF stands for "Capture The Flag" and is a type of challenge where you are given access to an environment (a set of files, a site, a remote system etc.), which you have to use in order to obtain and submit a special string called **flag**.
Now complete the challenges for today's session.
All flags follow this pattern:

```text
SSS{some_random_ASCII_characters}
```
