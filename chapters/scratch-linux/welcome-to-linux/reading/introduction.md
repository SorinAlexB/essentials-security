# Welcome to Linux

## Introduction

In this session, we will familiarise ourselves with our working environment.
We will learn how to set up a Kali Linux virtual machine and how to use its capabilities.
We will also introduce the programming language that we'll use throughout all sessions: Python.

## Prerequisites

- Fluency in the English language

- Basic programming knowledge (you are able to develop and run basic programs using integers, strings, arrays)

- The ability to use and search the internet

- Curiosity, thirst for knowledge

- Interest in cybersecurity

## What is Linux?

Well, [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is family of operating systems (OS's).
One such OS is [Kali Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Linux), which is specially designed for security enthusiasts.
This means that Kali comes with a few hundred preinstalled apps that are useful for anyone working in or learning about security.
We'll be using some of these apps throughout this track.

## Setting up Your Kali Virtual Machine

1. Start downloading the [Kali VM Image](https://security.cs.pub.ro/summer-school/wiki/_media/session/infrastructure/sss-kali-amd64.ova.torrent) torrent.

1. Download the VirtualBox installer for your system from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

1. Install VirtualBox using the installer you downloaded at step 2.

1. Start VirtualBox.

1. When the download started at step 1 finishes, press the **Import** button.

1. Select the downloaded `.ova` file (the VM image) in the newly opened window.

1. Click **Import**.
You'll be able to change the VM's resources later.
After the import finishes, the VM should appear to the left of the VirtualBox window

1. Click the VM and then click **Start**.

1. Use the username `root` and the password `toor` to log in.
