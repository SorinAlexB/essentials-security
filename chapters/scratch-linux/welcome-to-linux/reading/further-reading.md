## Altering the Prompt

You can modify your prompt while keeping the same user and hostname, by using the `PS1` **environment variable**.
Check out how you can do this [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/command-prompt-tell-me).

## Alternatives to Bash

There are quite a few alternatives to Bash, such as [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [DASH](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/dash.1.html).
Feel free to experiment with them in your free time.

## Hardcore Python

Python is well-known for being able to produce short code.
A part of this feature owes to its [list comprehensions](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-list-comprehension?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1455363063&utm_adgroupid=65083631748&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=b&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=278443377095&utm_targetid=aud-392016246653:dsa-486527602543&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=1011795&gclid=CjwKCAjw64eJBhAGEiwABr9o2NXKuiirYa09rYT-hLIh7th5Exg3vj9YPnpAT7EszhE539X_9guv1RoCvhIQAvD_BwE) and its [`join` function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-string-join-method/).

If you want to learn even more, take a look at Python's [built-in list operations](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#built-in-functions):
Learning about [lambda functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/lambda-functions-with-practical-examples-in-python-45934f3653a8) will surely ease your use of the above functions.
