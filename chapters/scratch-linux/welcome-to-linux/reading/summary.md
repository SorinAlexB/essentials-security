# Summary

## Linux

A quick rundown of the most important Linux commands from today's session is:

- `ls`: list the current directory;

- `cd <direcory>`: move to the specified directory;

- `mkdir` creates a new directory;

- `touch` creates a new file;

- `rm` deletes files and directories;

- `whoami`: prints the current user;

- `pwd`: prints the absolute path to the current directory;

- `cat`: output the contents of a file;

- `Tab`: your best friend in the whole world;

- `man <command>`: the source of infinite wisdom.

## Python

Some concepts to remember about Python are:

- There is no need for a `main` function or for types;

- Indentation is everything

- Basic arithmetic is almost the same as in C/C++;

- `if`s, `for`s, `while`s and function declarations all end in a colon (`:`);

- There's a difference between bytes and strings and they are **not** interchangeable.
