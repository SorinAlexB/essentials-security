# System Exploration

## Introduction

In the [previous session](../welcome-to-linux), we introduced the Linux OS family via Kali Linux.
With its help, we learned about the terminal and about basic file navigation commands, such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`.
We also talked about processes and the `ps` command.

In today's session, we'll extend these concepts and learn some new commands, that we'll use in order to further **explore** our systems.
We won't be learning any new Python tricks, but we'll be using it for scripts none

## Reminders and Prerequisites

For this session, you need to have a good understanding of last session's Linux concepts:

- using the `man` pages;
- using `Tab`;
- navigating the file system;
- creating and deleting new entries in the file system.

Make sure you have rehearsed and practiced them before the beginning of today's session.
